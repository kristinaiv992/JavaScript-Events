3 ways of Registering an event:
----------------------------------
1) using tag attributes (directly in - placing the javascript into the html)
2) using dot notation (onclick())
3) using the most modern way (addEventListener())


-----------------THE EVENTS PROPERTIES---------------------
*Capturing an event returns an object
It is important for us to know the:
-type of event - we want to know the event we are getting example click event
-timestamp - the time at which the event had happened
-defaultPrevented - we are preventing an event from happening ex. we are clicking
 a link but we dont want to be redirected to that page. So the value of this event will be true 
 since it is preventing us from moving into another tab

**1**
screen X,Y - is giving us the possition relative to the user screen
client X,Y - is giving us the possition relative to the window
Offset X,Y - is giving us the x and y possitions relative to the element that fires the events
Page X,Y - is giving us the events relative to the html document
--Some browsers use Layes X,Y - it gives us the possition of the element relative to another 
possitioned event that has to do with the css possitioning

Targeting info
toElement
Target - The target is the element that the event originated from
srcElement - is the actual element that fired an event
FromElement - deal with mouse over and mouse out events
ToElement - deal with mouse over and mouse out events

stopPropagation() - helps us to catch an event on a parent element 
(capture and bubble, setting false and adding e.stopPropagation())
preventDefault() - preventing from submitting a form or navigatinf to a web page etc.
